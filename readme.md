# Everest Study
## Intro

This is another one of my projects that I choose by seeing an interesting data set on Kaggle. The project 
is on social media health. There seems to be an article everywhere these days on social media health and we 
all know it ain't good. The Anxious Generation by Jonathan Haidt really nails this. I deciided to do the project 
simply as a good way to look at a decent, small dataset. We will see where it goes!

# Getting started
### Installing

Please note that these instructions are not 100% complete nor may they really work. 

1. Clone the repo
2. Run [sudo] pip3 install or pip3 install flask
3. Run python3 app.py to run the application
4. Visit localhost:5000 to see the application
5. Please note that these instructions only follow the Python side of this application.

### Technology Stack

1. Flask-0.12
2. Python-3.4
3. Pandas-0.18.1
4. Numpy-1.11.0
5. Vue.JS-2.5

### Operation

Once the program is downloaded, simply run the program as you would any other python program.
Then follow the address, which your console/terminal tells you to go to see the
website. Again, please do not forget to ensure that you have vue CLI installed
as well as npm. I also have to say that this part is really old so may not work! 

# Issues / Other

The only issue that I have is that I should have made it so that dates were not mandatory on the filter.
