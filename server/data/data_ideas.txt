## 🧠 Suggested “Story” with These Graphs

If this is for a project, you could frame it like this:

> “How does social media usage affect mental health and happiness?”

Flow:

1️⃣ Start: Age vs Screen Time
2️⃣ Then: Screen Time vs Happiness
3️⃣ Then: Sleep vs Stress
4️⃣ Then: Detox Days vs Stress
5️⃣ Then: Exercise vs Happiness
6️⃣ End: Platform Comparison

This creates a narrative, not just random charts.

## 🚀 If You’d Like

If you want, I can next:

✅ Suggest **which 3–4 graphs are best** for a paper/presentation
✅ Write **Python/Matplotlib code** for any of these
✅ Help you design this as a full mini research project
✅ Turn this into a dashboard concept

Just tell me what you’re using (Excel, Python, Tableau, Power BI, etc.).
